# Man Ho Cheung (Mos)
Graduated in September 2025 at Curtin University with a master's degree in Predictive Analytics, in Perth, Australia. Passionate about revealing actionable insights and building solutions through data visualisation, feature engineering, and predictive modelling in a machine learning workflow and enhancing operational efficiency using AI.

## Portfolio
Any feedback is appreciated.  
### [Medical Cost Prediction](https://github.com/moscmh/medicalcost)
The additional feature improved the model's performance, $R^2$, significantly to over $.96$.
* Data visualisation (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
* Feature engineering (`Gaussian Mixture Model`)
* Regression (`scikit-learn`)

### [Perth Fuel Price Forecast](https://github.com/moscmh/perthfuel)
The model with an exogenous feature, temperature, estimated that the fuel price in Perth will fluctuate around ADU177/100L in the coming two years, with a relatively lower price from November 2025 to April 2026.
* `Box-Jenkins`'s modelling framework
* Data manipulation (`MySQL`)
* Time-series analysis (`SARIMAX`)

### [British Airways Job Simulation](https://github.com/moscmh/britishairways)
This immersive data science workflow demonstrated how crucial exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing are to the model's performance.
* Downsampling to address extremely unbalanced classes, which improved the model's accuracy from 50%+ to 70%+.
* Enhanced model training efficiency with a data processing pipeline (`sklearn.pipeline`)
* Hyperparameter tuning using `Optuna`

### [Hong Kong Species Occurrence Predictions](https://github.com/moscmh/hkspecies)
The interactive web application aims to raise awareness in the Hong Kong precious species that are prone to extinction. The species occurrence predictions from the `CNN-LSTM` deep learning model also help local green groups with environmental monitoring and conservation planning. [Live Demo](http://3.25.93.9)
* Contains 2001-2024 Hong Kong 1000+ species occurrences `geospatial` data
* Data congregation and preprocessing for model training
* `CNN-LSTM` model to predict approximate locations
* `AWS Q Developer` UI design and `AWS Lightsail` instance for web application
